# Paprika

This is a discord bot designed in a Python-based library, for simplicity of
computation-esque and programming-relative tasks. The structure is simplified
for ease of scalability.

Unlike other bots, this bot utilizes the `discord.py` library directly - A
command framework is designed from scratch, rather than through utilizing the
`discord.ext.commands` library.

Commands can be placed within the `commands` folder in order to create a new
command. Every command has a main function, as well as an `async command()`
function, which can be executed. Commands will automatically be loaded into the
bot structure, and the `help` command will automatically update with new
commands.
